## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains the **backend services** of our decentralized application (DApp) project.  
The backend acts as the **core infrastructure**, connecting mobile frontends (React Native / Flutter) with blockchain services via RESTful APIs and upcoming smart contract integration.

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Language**: JavaScript (Node.js)
- **Framework**: Express.js (or similar)
- **Auth**: JWT / OAuth
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL (based on service needs)
- **Web3 Integration**: Ethers.js / Web3.js (for smart contract interaction)
- **API**: RESTful & ready for GraphQL extension
- **Infra**: Dockerized, scalable, and modular

---

## 🔗 Blockchain Integration (Upcoming)

- ✅ Token deployment via Solidity
- 🔄 Smart contract interactions (transfers, on-chain logic)
- 🔐 Wallet-based auth (MetaMask / WalletConnect / Web3Auth)
- 📡 Integration with Infura, Moralis, Alchemy
